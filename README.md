# Arduino-for-LabVIEW-Complex-Numbers
Implementation of complex numbers for LabVIEW. This VIs are for Arduino Compiler for LabVIEW from TSXperts (https://www.tsxperts.com/)
They are transcripted into arduino sketch and after that are compiled and upload to arduino compatibile board.
All complex numbers in implementation are created on heap and in LabVIEW they are represented as pointers, so you cannot add or multiply them with  normal add VI.
